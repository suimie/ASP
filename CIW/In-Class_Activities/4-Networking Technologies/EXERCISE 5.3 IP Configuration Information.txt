Finding Your IP Configuration Information in Windows

1. Click Start, and in the box type cmd and press Enter. This will open a command prompt.

2. At the prompt, type ipconfig and press Enter. This will display IP configuration information for your computer. Can you find your IP address, subnet mask, and (optional) default gateway?

The link-local address shown is an IPv6 address, which is written in hexadecimal.

3. At the prompt, type ipconfig /all and press Enter. This will show you much more information, including the address of your DHCP and DNS servers, if you have them.

4. Type exit and press Enter to close the command prompt.
