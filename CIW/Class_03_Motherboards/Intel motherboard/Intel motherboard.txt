Intel motherboard 
====================
Intel DX 79SI Extreme series motherboard with the individual components identified

1. RAM slots. This motherboard includes eight dual in-line memory module (DIMM) slots for double data rate type 3 (DDR3) memory.

2. SATA ports. Four SATA 3 GB/s ports and two SATA 6.0 GB/s ports are included. It’s not apparent in the figure, but the 3 GB/s ports are black and the 6 GB/s ports are blue, so that they can be distinguished from each other.

3. Intel X79 Express Chipset. This chipset uses the Direct Media Interface (DMI) as an interface to the CPU.

4. Voltage regulators covered by heat sinks. The heat sinks keep the voltage regulators cool. One is providing power for the CPU, and one is providing power to the chipset.

5. CPU socket. This socket is for an Intel Core i7 processor with either four or six cores.

6. One PCI expansion slot. This is for earlier-version PCI cards.

7. Three PCI e 3.0 x 16 expansion slots. These are for newer PCIe boards.

8. Power-on self test (POST) decoder. This displays different numbers as the system progresses through the startup cycle. It can be used for troubleshooting the motherboard in place of a PCI or PCIe card used for providing the same information.

9. USB ports 3.0 ports. These are accessible via the back panel. Other connectors on the board can be routed to USB connectors on the front panel.

10. Back panel ports. This group includes two RJ-45 network interface connections, one IEEE 1394 firewall connection, and six USB 2.0 connections.

11. Audio back panel ports. This group includes multiple connections for different types of audio, including 7.1 systems.

12. CMOS battery. This motherboard is using a circular battery, but the battery is inserted sideways into a battery slot.

13. PCI e x1 expansion slots. These are for smaller x1 cards.
