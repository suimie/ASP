                <p class="introduction">
                    From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind,
                    and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in
                    waves before the coming storm.
                </p>

                <p class="firstLetter">
                    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by
                    her sister on the 	bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
                    peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
                    conversations in it, <em>"and what is the use of a book,"</em> thought
                    Alice,<em> "without pictures or conversations?"</em>
                </p>

                <p class="dropCap">
                    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as
                    she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether
                    the pleasure of making a daisy-chain 	would be worth the trouble of getting
                    up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit 	with pink eyes
                    ran close to her.
                </p>
                <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so 
                very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &apos;Oh dear! Oh dear! 
                I shall be late!&apos; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that 
                she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); 
                but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked 
                at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her 
                mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, 
                or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the 
                field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large 
                rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
                <figure id="picture_box1">
                    <img class="picture" src="images/white_rabbit_checking_watch.gif"
                         alt="White Rabbit checking watch"
                         title="White Rabbit checking watch" />
                </figure>
                <p class="centerAlign"><b>White Rabbit checking watch</b></p>
                <p>In another moment down went Alice after it,
                never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
                </p>
                <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, 
                and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
                </p>
                <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, 
                for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder 
                what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out 
                what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; 
                then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled 
                with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures 
                hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; 
                it was labelled &apos;
                <span class="small_quat_mark upperCase">orange marmalade</span>
                    &apos;, but to her great disappointment it was empty:
                she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, 
                so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
                </p>
                <p>&apos;
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">Well!</span>&apos; thought Alice to herself, 
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        after such a fall as this,
                        I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&apos;ll all think me
                        at home! Why, I wouldn&apos;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
                        the house!
                    </span> (Which was very likely true.)
                </p>
                <p>Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end!&apos; 
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        I wonder how many miles I&apos;ve fallen by this time?
                    </span>&apos; she said aloud.&apos; 
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. 
                        Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--
                    </span>
                    &apos; (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her 
                    lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity 
                    for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, 
                    still it was good practice to say it over) &apos;
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        --yes, that&apos;s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude 
                        or Longitude I&apos;ve got to?
                    </span>
                    &apos; (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought 
                    they were nice grand words to say.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Presently she began again. &apos;I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!
                    How funny it&apos;ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads 
                    downward! The Antipathies, I think--&apos; (she was rather glad there was no one 
                    listening, this time, as it didn&apos;t sound at all the right word) 
                    &apos;
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        --but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
                        Please, Ma&apos;am, is this New Zealand or Australia?
                    </span>
                    &apos; (and she tried to curtsey
                    as she spoke--fancy curtseying as you&apos;re falling through the air! Do you
                    think you could manage it?) &apos;
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        And what an ignorant little girl she
                        &apos;ll think me for asking! No, it&apos;ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up
                        somewhere.
                    </span>
                    &apos;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking 
                    again. &apos;Dinah&apos;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&apos; 
                    (Dinah was the cat.) &apos;I hope they&apos;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.
                    Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the 
                    air, I&apos;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&apos;s very like a mouse, 
                    you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&apos; And here Alice began to get 
                    rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 
                    &apos;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&apos; and sometimes, &apos;Do bats eat cats?&apos; 
                    for, you see, as she couldn&apos;t answer either question, it didn&apos;t much matter
                    which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun
                    to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her 
                    very earnestly, &apos;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?&apos; 
                    when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry 
                    leaves, and the fall was over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: 
                    she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long 
                    passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. 
                    There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was 
                    just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 
                    &apos;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&apos;s getting!&apos; 
                    She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no 
                    longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up
                    by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; 
                    and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, 
                    trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was 
                    ever to get out again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;
                    there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&apos;s first thought
                    was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either
                    the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would
                    not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
                    curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about
                    fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her
                    great delight it fitted!

                    </figure>
                </p>
                <p class="centerAlign"><b>Alice finding tiny door behind curtain</b></p>
                <p>
                    Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage,
                    not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
                    into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that
                    dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those
                    cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway;
                    &apos;and even if my head would go through,&apos;
                    thought poor Alice,
                    &apos;it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish
                    I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to
                    begin.&apos;
                    For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
                    that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
                    impossible.
                    <figure id="picture_box3">

                <p class="centerAlign"><b>Alice taking drink me bottle</b></p>
                <p>
                    It was all very well to say &apos;Drink me,&apos; but the wise little Alice was not 
                    going to do that in a hurry. &apos;No, I&apos;ll look first,&apos; she said, 
                    &apos;and see whether it&apos;s marked "poison" or not&apos;; for she had read several nice 
                    little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild 
                    beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the 
                    simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker 
                    will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very 
                    deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, 
                    if you drink much from a bottle marked &apos;poison,&apos; it is almost certain to 
                    disagree with you, sooner or later.
                </p>

                <p id="astrics_2">******</p>
                <p id="astrics_1_3">*******</p>
                <p>
                    &apos;What a curious feeling!&apos; said Alice; &apos;
                    I must be shutting up like a telescope.&apos;
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face 
                    brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going 
                    through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited 
                    for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: 
                    she felt a little nervous about this; &apos;for it might end, you know,&apos; 
                    said Alice to herself, &apos;in my going out altogether, like a candle. 
                    I wonder what I should be like then?&apos; And she tried to fancy what the flame 
                    of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not 
                    remember ever having seen such a thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going 
                    into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, 
                    she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to 
                    the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: 
                    she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to 
                    climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she 
                    had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &apos;Come, there&apos;s no use in crying like that!&apos; said Alice to herself, 
                    rather sharply; &apos;I advise you to leave off this minute!&apos; 
                    She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom 
                    followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring 
                    tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for 
                    having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
                    for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. 
                    &apos;But it&apos;s no use now,&apos; thought poor Alice, &apos;to pretend to be two people! 
                    Why, there&apos;s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!&apos;

                <p>
                    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: 
                    she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 
                    &apos;EAT ME&apos; were beautifully marked in currants. &apos;Well, I&apos;ll eat it,&apos; 
                    said Alice, &apos;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; 
                    and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way 
                    I&apos;ll get into the garden, and I don&apos;t care which happens!&apos;
                </p>
                <p>
                    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, &apos;Which way? Which way?&apos;, 
                    holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and 
                    she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, 
                    this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the 
                    way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed 
                    quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
