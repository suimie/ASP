                <h2 class="chapterTitle">The Pool of Tears</h2>
                <p class="firstLetter">
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Curiouser and curiouser!&apos;</span>
                    cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to
                    speak good English);
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;now I&apos;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!&apos;</span>
                    (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight,
                    they were getting so far off).
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
                        your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I&apos;m sure I shan&apos;t be able!
                        I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you:
                        you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be kind to them,&apos;
                    </span>
                    thought Alice,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;or perhaps they won&apos;t walk the way I want to go! Let me see:
                        I&apos;ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.&apos;
                    </span>
                </p>
                <figure class="picture_box_left">
                    <img src="images/alice_stretched_tall.gif" alt="Alice stretched tall" title="Alice stretched tall" />

                </figure>
                <p>
                    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;They must go by the carrier,&apos;
                    </span>
                    she thought;
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;and how funny it&apos;ll seem, sending presents to one&apos;s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
                        <span id="message1"><br />ALICE&apos;S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</span>
                        <span id="message2"><br />HEARTHRUG,</span>
                        <span id="message3"><br />NEAR THE FENDER,</span>
                        <span id="message4"><br />(WITH ALICE&apos;S LOVE).</span>
                        <br />Oh dear, what nonsense I&apos;m talking!&apos;
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than
                    nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the
                    garden door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through
                    into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever:
                    she sat down and began to cry again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&apos;
                    </span>
                    said Alice,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;a great girl like you,&apos;
                    </span>
                    (she might well say this),
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!&apos;
                    </span>
                    But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large
                    pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily
                    dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly
                    dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other:
                    he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won&apos;t she be savage if I&apos;ve kept her waiting!&apos;
                    </span>
                    Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one;
                    so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;If you please, sir--&apos;
                    </span>
                    The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves
                    and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
                </p>
                <figure class="picture_box_right">
                    <img src="images/giant_alice_watching_rabbit_run_away.gif" alt="Giant Alice watching rabbit run away" title="Giant Alice watching rabbit run away" />
                    <figcaption><b>Giant Alice watching rabbit run away</b></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning
                    herself all the time she went on talking:
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!
                        And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I&apos;ve been changed in the
                        night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can
                        remember feeling a little different. But if I&apos;m not the same, the next question is,
                        Who in the world am I? Ah, that&apos;s the great puzzle!&apos;
                    </span>
                    And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself,
                    to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not Ada,&apos;
                    </span>
                    she said,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn&apos;t go in ringlets
                        at all; and I&apos;m sure I can&apos;t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things,
                        and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she&apos;s she, and I&apos;m I,
                        and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I&apos;ll try if I know all the things
                        I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is
                        thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
                        rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn&apos;t signify: let&apos;s try Geography.
                        London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no,
                        that&apos;s all wrong, I&apos;m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I&apos;ll try
                        and say "How doth the little--"&apos;
                    </span>
                    and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to
                    repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the
                    same as they used to do:--<br />
                </p>
                <div class=" centerAlign song">
                    &apos;How doth the little crocodile<br />
                    Improve his shining tail,<br />
                    And pour the waters of the Nile<br />
                    On every golden scale!<br /><br />

                    How cheerfully he seems to grin,<br />
                    How neatly spread his claws,<br />
                    And welcome little fishes in<br />
                    With gently smiling jaws!&apos;
                </div>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;I&apos;m sure those are not the right words,&apos;
                    </span>
                    said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and
                        live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh!
                        ever so many lessons to learn! No, I&apos;ve made up my mind about it;
                        if I&apos;m Mabel, I&apos;ll stay down here! It&apos;ll be no use their putting their heads down
                        and saying <span class="poison">&quot;Come up again, dear!&quot;</span>
                        I shall only look up and say
                        <span class="poison">
                            &quot;Who am I then?
                            Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I&apos;ll come up:
                            if not, I&apos;ll stay down here till I&apos;m somebody else&quot;
                        </span>
                        --but, oh dear!&apos;
                    </span>
                    cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone
                        here!&apos;
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
                    that she had put on one of the Rabbit&apos;s little white kid gloves while she was talking.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;How can I have done that?&apos;</span>
                    she thought.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;I must be growing small again.&apos;</span>
                    She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,
                    as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on
                    shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was
                    holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;That was a narrow escape!&apos;</span>
                    said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find
                    herself still in existence;
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;and now for the garden!&apos;</span>
                    and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was
                    shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;and things are worse than ever,&apos;</span>
                    thought the poor child,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it&apos;s too bad,
                        that it is!&apos;
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
                    she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;and in that case I can go back by railway,&apos;</span>
                    she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the
                    general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number
                    of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades,
                    then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)
                    However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept
                    when she was nine feet high.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;I wish I hadn&apos;t cried so much!&apos;</span>
                    said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;I shall be punished for it now, I suppose,
                        by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure!
                        However, everything is queer to-day.&apos;
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off,
                    and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a
                    walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she
                    soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Would it be of any use, now,&apos;</span>
                    thought Alice,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;to speak to this mouse? Everything is so
                        out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk:
                        at any rate, there&apos;s no harm in trying.&apos;
                    </span>
                    So she began:
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?
                        I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!&apos;
                    </span>
                    (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done
                    such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother&apos;s Latin Grammar,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!&apos;</span>
                    The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of
                    its little eyes, but it said nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Perhaps it doesn&apos;t understand English,&apos;</span>
                    thought Alice;
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;I daresay it&apos;s a French mouse, come over with
                        William the Conqueror.&apos;
                    </span>
                    (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
                    anything had happened.) So she began again:
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Ou est ma chatte?&apos;</span>
                    which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap
                    out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Oh, I beg your pardon!&apos;</span>
                    cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal&apos;s feelings.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;I quite forgot you didn&apos;t like cats.&apos;</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Not like cats!&apos;</span>
                    cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Would you like cats if you were me?&apos;</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Well, perhaps not,&apos;</span>
                    said Alice in a soothing tone:
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;don&apos;t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could
                        show you our cat Dinah: I think you&apos;d take a fancy to cats if you could only see
                        her. She is such a dear quiet thing,&apos;
                    </span>
                    Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing
                        her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she&apos;s such a capital
                        one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!&apos;
                    </span>
                    cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
                    certain it must be really offended.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;We won&apos;t talk about her any more if you&apos;d
                        rather not.&apos;
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;We indeed!&apos;</span>
                    cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats:
                        nasty, low, vulgar things! Don&apos;t let me hear the name again!&apos;
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;I won&apos;t indeed!&apos;</span>
                    said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?&apos;</span>
                    The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
                        A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!
                        And it&apos;ll fetch things when you throw them, and it&apos;ll sit up and beg for its
                        dinner, and all sorts of things--I can&apos;t remember half of them--and it belongs
                        to a farmer, you know, and he says it&apos;s so useful, it&apos;s worth a hundred pounds!
                        He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!&apos;
                    </span>
                    cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">&apos;II&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve offended it again!&apos;</span>
                    For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a
                    commotion in the pool as it went.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So she called softly after it,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won&apos;t talk about cats or dogs either,
                        if you don&apos;t like them!&apos;
                    </span>
                    When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her:
                    its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
                    trembling voice,
                    <span class="small_quat_mark">
                        &apos;Let us get to the shore, and then I&apos;ll tell you my history, and you
                        &apos;ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.&apos;
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds
                    and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an
                    Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party
                    swam to the shore.
