                    <h1>Early life and education</h1>
                    <p>
                        Lewis Carroll was born Charles Lutwidge Dodgson on January 27, 1832,
                        the eldest son and third of eleven children born to Frances Jane
                        Lutwidge and the Reverend Charles Dodgson. Carroll had a happy
                        childhood. His mother was patient and gentle, and his father,
                        despite his religious duties, tutored all of his children and
                        raised them to be good people. Carroll frequently made up games
                        and wrote stories and poems, some of which were similar to his
                        later published works, for his seven sisters and three brothers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although his years at Rugby School (1846–49) were unhappy,
                        he was recognized as a good student, and in 1850 he was admitted
                        to further study at Christ Church, Oxford, England. He graduated
                        in 1854, and in 1855 he became mathematical lecturer
                        (more like a tutor) at the college. This permanent appointment,
                        which not only recognized his academic skills but also paid him a
                        decent sum, required Carroll to take holy orders in the Anglican
                        Church and to remain unmarried. He agreed to these requirements
                        and was made a deacon in 1861.

                    <h1>Photography and early publication</h1>
                    <p>
                        Among adults Carroll was reserved, but he did not avoid their
                        company as some reports have stated. He attended the theater
                        frequently and was absorbed by photography and writing.
                        After taking up photography in 1856, he soon found that his
                        favorite subjects were children and famous people, including
                        English poet Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809–1892), Italian painter
                        and poet D. G. Rossetti (1828–1882), and English painter John
                        Millais (1829–1896). Helmut Gernsheim wrote of Carroll&apos;s
                        photographs of children, "He achieves an excellence which in its
                        way can find no peer." Though photography was mostly a hobby,
                        Carroll spent a great deal of time on it until 1880.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the mid-1850s Carroll also began writing both humorous and
                        mathematical works. In 1856 he created the pseudonym
                        (assumed writing name) "Lewis Carroll" by translating his first and
                        middle names into Latin, reversing their order, then translating them
                        back into English. His mathematical writing, however, appeared under
                        his real name.

                    <h1>Alice books</h1>
                    <p>
                        In 1856 Carroll met Alice Liddell, the four-year-old daughter of 
                        the head of Christ Church. During the next few years Carroll often 
                        made up stories for Alice and her sisters. In July 1862, while on a 
                        picnic with the Liddell girls, Carroll recounted the adventures of 
                        a little girl who fell into a rabbit hole. Alice asked him to write
                        the story out for her. He did so, calling it Alice&apos;s Adventures 
                        under Ground. After some changes, this work was published in 1865 
                        as Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland with illustrations by John 
                        Tenniel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Encouraged by the book&apos;s success, Carroll wrote a second volume,
                        Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There (1872). 
                        Based on the chess games Carroll played with the Liddell children, 
                        it included material he had written before he knew them. 
                        The first section of "Jabberwocky," for example, was written in 1855.
                        More of Carroll&apos;s famous Wonderland characters—such as Humpty Dumpty, 
                        the White Knight, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee—appear in this work 
                        than in Alice in Wonderland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike most of the children&apos;s books of the day, Alice and Through 
                        the Looking Glass did not attempt to convey obvious moral lessons. 
                        Nor did they contain what critics have tried to insist are 
                        there—hidden meanings relating to religion or politics. 
                        They are delightful adventure stories in which a normal, healthy, 
                        clearheaded little girl reacts to the "reality" of the adult world. 
                        Their appeal to adults as well as to children lies in Alice&apos;s 
                        intelligent response to ridiculous language and action.

                    <p>
                        The Reverend C. L. Dodgson was a reserved, fussy bachelor who 
                        refused to get wrapped up in the political and religious storms 
                        that troubled England during his lifetime. Lewis Carroll, however, 
                        was a delightful, lovable companion to the children for whom he
                        created his nonsense stories and poems. Biographers and historians 
                        have long been confused that one man could have two completely 
                        different sides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One solution is that he had two personalities: "Lewis Carroll" and 
                        "the Reverend Mr. Dodgson," with the problems that go along with 
                        having a split personality. There were peculiar things about him—he 
                        stammered ever since he was a child, he was extremely fussy about 
                        his possessions, and he walked as much as twenty miles a day. 
                        But another solution seems more nearly correct: "Dodgson" and 
                        "Carroll" were parts of one personality. This personality, because 
                        of happiness in childhood and unhappiness in the years thereafter, 
                        could blossom only in a world that resembled the happy one he knew 
                        while growing up.
